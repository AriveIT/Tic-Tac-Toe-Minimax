Optimization
1. Symmetry
	- symmetric hash key (symmetric grids give same hash or search all symmetric grids' hash keys)
	- don't explore symmetric moves
2. Copying (currently accounts for about 70% of computation time)

Quality of life
1. Clean up minimax function
2. Add player class
3. Function where you can give 2 players/agents and it will run n games
